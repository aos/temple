# Temple 

A Hugo theme focused on content, cleanliness, speed and responsiveness. The main
goal of this theme is to be simple and fast.

> This is a fork of [nofancy](https://github.com/gizak/nofancy) with many
improvements.

A live version of this theme can be found 
[on my personal blog](https://aos.github.io).

## Getting Started
If you have not already created a blog, I recommend you check out my [getting
started guide](https://aos.github.io/2017/11/23/practical-guide-to-setting-up-a-hugo-blog/) for a comprehensive overview. Otherwise, just download it or clone it into
your `themes/` directory:
```
$ cd themes && git clone https://github.com/aos/temple.git
```
Then reference it in your `config`:
```
theme = "temple"
```
Or when building the site, pass it in to the CLI:
```
$ hugo -t temple
```

## Customizing
Your `config` file will hold all your options:
```
baseURL = "https://aos.github.io/"
title = "Your Blog Title"
theme = "temple"
# If not set, it will not appear. Otherwise it will show below your footer links
copyright = "(c) 2008 - 2014"
